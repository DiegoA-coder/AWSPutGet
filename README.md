# AWSPutGet

This program implements Get and Put operations for objects stored in AWS S3

## Authentication
  Authentication can be done in two ways

  ### Profile in CLI
  For this mode you have to have the previous configuration in the aws CLI terminal with the corresponding keys.

  ### Access keys
  For this mode, the AWS keys are obtained from the .env file, thus avoiding having them directly in the code
